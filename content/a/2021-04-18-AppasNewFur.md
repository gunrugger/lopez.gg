## Insulation!

I finally got the thing insulated. The nights have since been super warm.

I intend to finish it with some panellin that looks nicer, but I think I might hire a contractor to do that part. I want it to look good. I also intend to have someone (maybe the same person) build me some cabinets or drawers in the top compartment that is currently an awkward shelf.

NGL. When I was gluing in the fiberglass strips it felt like that episode where spongebob and patrick were strapping sandy's fur onto themselves ðŸ˜†
